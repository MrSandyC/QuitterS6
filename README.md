# QuitterS6
Project made during the 6th semester of my bachelor in IT &amp; Software Engineering

## Work in Progress
As I am still working on improving the stack and other pieces that come with this project, this will keep evolving. The project is set public to allow SonarCloud to scan the project for possible code smells, duplicate code etc.
